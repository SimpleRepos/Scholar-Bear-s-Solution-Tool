This program is a simple solution finder for Scholar Bear's Math Game in the
Nintendo DS title, "Final Fantasy - The 4 Heroes of Light". 

Just enter the numbers provided by Scholar Bear and click the button. A set of
instructions will appear below leading you to the highest possible score for
the given set.

If the resulting score is too low for you then you can just skip the set for
a 3-point penalty and go for a set that gives a higher score value. Skipping
an un-solvable set will give you a 20-point bonus.

Your objective is something like 250 points in 3 rounds, so making an average
of 85 or so points will get you there, which isn't that hard. Getting the
required score will give you the Beastmaster Crown, which doubles the base
stats of any party member that's in animal form. (Very powerful!)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Since Scholar Bear's game is very similar to the Final Fantasy 4 DS game,
"Rydia's Mathemagical Solutions" you can use this tool to solve Rydia's
challenges as well.

I believe Rydia will never give you an unsolvable set. The main difference
between the games is that rather than going for a certain score for each set,
with Rydia you're trying to find as many solutions as possible during a
specific amount of time.

In order to get a high score from her, glance at the numbers and then close
the DS lid to pause the timer. (Don't slam the lid shut too hard or the game
may crash. True story.)

Enter the numbers into the solver and memorize the solution, then open the DS
and enter it as fast as you can. Be ready for the next set to pop up
afterwards. Rinse and repeat.

If you can get 9999 points in 3 seperate challenges then you'll have maxxed
out Whyt's INT stat and you get a special outfit for him.
